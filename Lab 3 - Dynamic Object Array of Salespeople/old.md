# Lab3
## Lab3 Assignment Repository

**Lab3 includes two Java files. Please maintain the filenames in your lab.**

Remember to completely fill out the header blocks and *remove any documentation reminders* in the Java template files.

As you work on **Lab3** remember to **Save All**, **Commit** (with a message) and **Push Upstream** as often as possible.

## When your Lab3 is complete do the following:

1. Save the project (Save All)
2. Commit with a descriptive message
3. Push Upstream to your Repository
4. Go to your GitHub repository in a Web Browser
5. Take a screen shot of your **repository main page** making sure the repository name and last commit message are present
6. Go to your eLearning DropBox
7. Upload your repository image named **Lab3classID** to the DropBox. So if Bubba Jones submitted, it would be **Lab3bjones4242**
8. Place your complete **repository URL (copy and paste it)** into the DropBox comment section
9. Submit your DropBox

### Failure to follow these submission instructions may result in Lab3 not being evaluated.

**Remember to save and commit often.**
